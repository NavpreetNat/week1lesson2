# FinTech Domains, Part 1

Times are changing! Now that you're familiar with some of the technological factors that have led to change in the finance world as a whole, it's time to go deeper into how technology has affected FinTech domains specifically and altered traditional finance activities.

Working in groups of two or three people, you will research the following FinTech domains:

* Payments and Remittances

* Robo Advisors and Personal Finance

* RegTech

* Digital Banking

* InsurTech

* Alternative Finance

## Instructions

* Create a document containing the names and definitions of each FinTech domain.

* Research each domain and use your findings to answer the following questions:

  * What does the particular FinTech domain do? What is its purpose?

  * What is the competitive landscape? Who are its main contenders?

  * What are the main factors for change in the domain? How is the domain being disrupted by innovation?

  * What are the technologies used?

  * What is its past, present, and future growth?

## Hint

Try using collaborative tools like Google Docs to work more efficiently with your group members.

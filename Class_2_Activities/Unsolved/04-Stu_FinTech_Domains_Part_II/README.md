# FinTech Domains, Part 2

In this activity, you will build on the research you did in Part 1 and think more about the future of each FinTech domain, given their current trajectories. Working in the same groups, create headlines for each FinTech domain that one could expect to see in the news within the next five years.

## Instructions

Use your research and answers to the questions in Part 1 to produce news headlines for each FinTech domain that fit the following criteria:

* Headlines should represent an event, outcome, or characteristic of each FinTech domain that could potentially occur within the next five years.

* Headlines might focus on the future event of a company, a sociopolitical outcome of the disruption in a specific FinTech domain, or a continuing FinTech trend.

* Headlines should be supported by your research.

Be prepared to present your headlines and participate in a class discussion.

## Hint

As you brainstorm, think about the trends in each FinTech domain today, and how these current trends might affect the future of the FinTech landscape.
